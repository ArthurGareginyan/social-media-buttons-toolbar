== Description ==

An easy to use, with intuitive interface, WordPress plugin that gives you the ability to easily and safely add a smart bar with social media follow buttons (not share, only links to your social media profiles) to any place (post content, page content, widget, sidebar, header, footer) of your WordPress website.

The social media follow buttons bar - is a bar with set of icons of the popular social media which are linked directly to your profile on this social networks. I.e. clicking the TikTok icon will take the user to your TikTok page, clicking the Likee icon will take them to your Likee page.

Unlike the other plugins, this plugin creates a live bar. The bar automatically adapt to the width of the block where it placed. If the buttons do not fit to the one line, then they will be placed on multiple lines. So they can be arranged horizontally or vertically, in one line or in a few, and all of this is done automatically.

This plugin give you finer control over buttons. You can configure they on plugins settings page. You can choose the size of icons, choose open link in current tab or in new, and etc. Also you can have the social media follow buttons automatically added to the bottom of all Posts and/or Pages, or position them manually using either a widget, shortcode or template action hook. If you want more options, then let us know and we will be happy to add them.

Its purpose is to provide a familiar experience to WordPress users. You don't need to edit any file of your theme, this plugin will do everything for you. It's just plug and play, no tedious configurations or hacks, just install, enable and start enjoying your fancy social media follow buttons. It's that simple!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. Will this plugin work on my wordpress.COM website? =
A. Sorry, this plugin is available for use only on self-hosted (wordpress.ORG) websites.

= Q. Can I use this plugin on my language? =
A. Yes. This plugin is ready for translation and has already been translated into several languages. But If your language is not available then you can make one. It is also possible that not all existing translations are up-to-date or correct, so you are welcome to make corrections. Many of plugin users would be delighted if you share your translation with the community. Thanks for your contribution!

= Q. How does it work? =
A. Simply go to the plugin settings page, select the desired settings and click the "Save changes" button. Enjoy your fancy social media follow buttons. It's that simple!
You can find the plugin settings page at "`WordPress Admin Area`" -> "`Settings`" -> "`Follow Buttons`".

= Q. Can I configure my buttons bar instance? =
A. Yes. On the "Settings" tab, select the desired settings and click the "Save changes" button. It's that simple!
You can find the plugin settings page at "`WordPress Admin Area`" -> "`Settings`" -> "`Follow Buttons`".

= Q. How many buttons bar instances can I create? =
A. The free version of this plugin supports only 1 instance of the buttons bar.
In the premium version of this plugin you can create up to 10 of buttons bar instances. This is very useful, because that way you can manage your buttons bar instances separately. Soon we will remove the limit on the number of buttons bar instances so that you can create an unlimited number of buttons bar instances.

= Q. Does this plugin requires any modification of the theme? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin is configurable entirely from the plugin settings page that you can find in the Admin Area of your WordPress website.

= Q. Does this require any knowledge of HTML or CSS? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin can be configured with no knowledge of HTML or CSS, using an easy-to-use plugin settings page.

= Q. What I need to do if the Google PageSpeed test says that this plugin images must be compressed? =
A. The images that uses in this plugin are already compressed, but we will do our best to find out what else can be done with the images in order to compress them even better.

= Q. It's not working. What could be wrong? =
A. As with every plugin, it's possible that things don't work. It's impossible to tell what could be wrong exactly. The most common reason for this is a web browser’s cache. Every web browser stores a cache of the websites you visit (pages, images, and etc.) to reduce bandwidth usage and server load. This is called the browser’s cache. Clearing your browser’s cache may solve the problem.

If you post a support request in the plugin's support forum on WordPress.org, we'd be happy to give it a look and try to help out. Please include as much information as possible, including a link to your website where the problem can be seen.

= Q. The last WordPress update is preventing me from editing my website that is using this plugin. Why is this? =
A. This plugin can not cause such problem. More likely, the problem are related to the settings of the website. It could just be a cache, so please try to clear your website's cache (may be you using a caching plugin, or some web service such as the CloudFlare) and then the cache of your web browser. Also please try to re-login to the website, this too can help.

= Q. Where to report bug if found? =
A. Bug reports are very welcome! Please visit [our contact page](https://www.spacexchimp.com/contact.html) and report. Thank you!

= Q. Where to share any ideas or suggestions to make the plugin better? =
