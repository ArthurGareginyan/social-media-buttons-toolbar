Easily add the smart bar with social media follow buttons (not share, only link to your social media profiles) to any place of your WordPress website.


== Description ==

An easy to use, with intuitive interface, WordPress plugin that gives you the ability to easily add the smart bar with social media follow buttons to any place (post, page, widget, sidebar, footer) of your WordPress website.

The Social Media Follow Buttons Bar - is a bar with set of icons of the popular social media which are linked directly to your profile on this social networks. I.e. clicking the Facebook icon will take the user to your Facebook page, clicking the Twitter icon will take them to your Twitter page.

Unlike the other plugins, this plugin creates a live bar. The bar automatically adapt to the width of the block where it placed. If the buttons do not fit to the one line, then they will be placed on multiple lines. So they can be arranged horizontally or vertically, in one line or in a few, and all of this is done automatically. Also it can be aligned to left, center or right.

It give you finer control over buttons. You can configure they on plugins settings page. You can choose the size of icons, choose open link in current tab or in new, and etc. Also you can have the social media follow buttons automatically added to the bottom of all post or/and pages, and can position the link buttons using either a widget, a shortcode or a template action hook. If you want more options then tell us and we will be happy to add it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. Will this plugin work on my WordPress.COM website? =
A. Sorry, this plugin is available for use only on self-hosted (WordPress.ORG) websites.

= Q. Can I use this plugin on my language? =
A. Yes. This plugin is ready for translation and has already been translated into several languages. But If your language is not available then you can make one. The POT file is included and placed in the "`languages`" folder. Just [send the PO file to us](https://www.spacexchimp.com/contact.html) and we will include this translation within the next plugin update. Many of plugin users would be delighted if you share your translation with the community. Thanks for your contribution!

= Q. How does it work? =
A. Simply go to the plugin settings page, select the desired settings and click the "Save changes" button. Enjoy your fancy social media follow buttons. It's that simple!
You can find the plugin settings page at "`WordPress Admin Area`" -> "`Settings`" -> "`Social Media Follow Buttons`".

= Q. Does this plugin requires any modification of the theme? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin is configurable entirely from the plugin settings page that you can find in the Admin Area of your WordPress website.

= Q. Does this require any knowledge of HTML or CSS? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin can be configured with no knowledge of HTML or CSS, using an easy-to-use plugin settings page.

= Q. What I need to do if the Google PageSpeed test says that this plugin images must be compressed? =
A. The images that uses in this plugin are already compressed, but I will do my best to find out what else can be done with the images in order to compress them even better.

= Q. It's not working. What could be wrong? =
A. As with every plugin, it's possible that things don't work. The most common reason for this is a web browser's cache. Every web browser stores a cache of the websites you visit (pages, images, and etc.) to reduce bandwidth usage and server load. This is called the browser's cache.​ Clearing your browser's cache may solve the problem.

It's impossible to tell what could be wrong exactly, but if you post a support request in the plugin's support forum on WordPress.org, we'd be happy to give it a look and try to help out. Please include as much information as possible, including a link to your website where the problem can be seen.

= Q. The last WordPress update is preventing me from editing my website that is using this plugin. Why is this? =
A. This plugin can not cause such problem. More likely, the problem are related to the settings of the website. It could just be a cache, so please try to clear your website's cache (may be you using a caching plugin, or some web service such as the CloudFlare) and then the cache of your web browser. Also please try to re-login to the website, this too can help.

= Q. Where to report bug if found? =
A. Bug reports are very welcome! Please visit [our contact page](https://www.spacexchimp.com/contact.html) and report. Thank you!

= Q. Where to share any ideas or suggestions to make the plugin better? =
